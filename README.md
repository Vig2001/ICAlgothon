I was personally responsible for addressing the QRT Problem - which involved analysing a large dataset containing weather data, energy consumption, production and trade between France and Germany, etc. to predict energy futures prices. This was not a time series forecasting task but more of a data science modelling task. 

I fitted a lasso regression model leveraging foundational supply-demand theory to result in a top-performing team. I learned vital skills in regularisation, data transformations and feature selection and opened my eyes to how difficult real-world data can be and that it is truly a skill to conduct exploratory data analysis.
